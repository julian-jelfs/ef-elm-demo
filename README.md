# Education First Elm Demo

This is a simple project to show the very basics of elm including:

* models
* views
* updating via actions
* basic api calls
* JSON decoding
* RemoteData

We will pick up some important information about the language and the type
system along the way.

To run this app, clone the the repo, make sure that you have Elm installed and
create-elm-app installed globally, then run:

```bash
elm-app start
```
